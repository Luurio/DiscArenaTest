# Disc Arena Test Project!


# Description
Disc Arena is an arcade block breaker where the player would shoot a disc and attempt to destroy a treasure chest. Once the player successfully destroys the chest they win. 

The current project is a **proof of concept** of the game and it only has one level. Once the chest is destroyed the player can only restart. The project does not include a main menu or a shop and it also does not contain sound/music. It only vibrates when the disc does damage to obstacles.

The game was developed using unity version **2020.3.30f1**
